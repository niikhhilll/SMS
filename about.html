        The ABC Education Foundation provides financial support and enrichment
        programs for ABCUSD students.&nbsp;Founded by committed educators and
        staff, one of the primary goals was to provide support for ABC students,
        pre-school through adult school.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foundation strongly
        believes that only through community support can we begin to overcome
        the budget cuts that ABC education programs have suffered in the past
        four years. Only through your support can we provide the best
        educational opportunities for our students. When you invest in the ABC
        Education Foundation with your donation, you are joining us with a
        strong statement of support for this concept—that our children deserve
        the best education possible. That our community will continue to provide
        the best school district in the area. That our children and their future
        are that important to you.<br />&nbsp;<br />The ABC Education Foundation
        works with local corporations, retailers, business people, educators,
        parents, caretakers and grandparents to ensure that an ABCUSD education
        is the best it can be.<br />&nbsp;<br />To learn more about the ABCUSD
        events, grants planning, fundraisers, visit the “What We Do” section. To

        The ABC Education Foundation was founded in 2010, and given approval on
        June 16, 2011 as a 501 (c) (3), which gives the district exempt status
        from Federal income tax of the Internal Revenue Code. The Foundation was
        formed to support district programs that do not receive the funding they
        need for students success. The Foundation provides financial support and
        enrichment programs for all schools in ABC.&nbsp;The ABC Education
        Foundation is organized to conduct fundraising and technical assistance
        support to the ABC Unified School District.<br /><br />ABC serves thirty
        schools with a student population of approximately 21,500 (K-12)
        students in five major communities, which include the cities of Artesia,
        Cerritos, Hawaiian Gardens, Lakewood and Norwalk.<br />ABC is considered
        by the U.S. Census survey as one of the most ethnically and
        <br />linguistically diverse communities in the United States.<br />The
        ABC Education Foundation is committed to the nurturing and development
        of every&nbsp;student that attends the ABCUSD. The ABC Education
        Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded to support the district’s
        educational goal of raising student achievement.<br />Some of our annual
        activities include: an&nbsp; annual 5K Fun Run/Walk, free backpacks with
        school supplies for financially disadvantaged students, and our annual
        mini-grant program where we give back the funds we've raised to fund
        important programs at schools throughout the ABC Unified School
        District.
